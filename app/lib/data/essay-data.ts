        post: "Recently, I've been at the hospital because my wife needed surgery. Thankfully, it went well. When we got there, she shared a room with three others: one healing and ready to get back to normal, one just out of surgery, and a young woman fighting stage 3 cancer.\n\n In a few days, as they started getting better, they left, making room for new patients. These new faces made me see life differently.\n\n You might have heard Steve Jobs talk about living as if it's your last day. He said it makes you think hard about what you're doing with your life. I used to just think about this, but now I really get it.\n\n One patient, very sick, was in a lot of pain.It was clear she didn't have much time left. Another patient, who had just arrived, was trying to be strong in front of her daughter. But once alone, she cried, scared about her upcoming surgery.\n\n Seeing their pain and bravery made me want to live better.Knowing we won't be here forever pushes us to keep getting better every single day.\n\n What's holding you back? Complete that unfinished project, share your feelings with your loved ones, step away from that unfulfilling job, and truly start living!"
